## Installation
To install this library into your Unity project you will need to download the repository, extract the .zip and import the scripts into your project. We plan to add the option to install it via the package manager in the near future. 

## Usage
We are still working the scripts at present, All scripts in the library have ample commenting on them to help you understand what does what. We hope to provide a more complete documentation section in the near furture, when we are happy with the library. 

### Namespace
All scripts in the library are under the following namespace:
`CarterGames.Utilities`. You will need to be using this namespace to access the scripts in this library. 

### Scripts
Currently the scripts are organised into folders based on their function, some scripts are batched together as they have a dependancy on each other to function, for instance the `Dark Mode UI` script is needed for both `Dark Mode UI Text` & `Dark Mode UI Image` to function properly. Some of our scripts have dependancies, these are clearly written in the header comment of each script, below are the dependancies for packages outside of the library which you will need to be using to fully use the library in Unity:

`UI Button Switch` - New Unity Input System - Setup is specific, but the header comment provides the lines that need changing for an alternative setup.
